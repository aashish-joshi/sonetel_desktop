# Sonetel Desktop

This is an experimental desktop app, based on the Electron framework, for the Sonetel service.

It renders the web app running at app.sonetel.com in a desktop window.

## Install

Pre-build binaries are available in [releases](https://github.com/aashish-joshi/sonetel_desktop/releases).

At the moment only binaries for Windows and Linux (deb and rpm both) are available.

## Limitations

- When you click on a link, it does not open in the native browser. Instead it opens in a browser window inside the app.
